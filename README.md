# Nokia5110/PCD8544 LCD Image Creator

This web application allows you to create 48 rows x 84 cols dot matrixc image and convet it to an array to be used in your Arduino or Raspbeery Pi programming for Nokia5110/PCD8544 display. You can use it on my [website](https://www.e-tinkers.com/nokia5110-lcd-image-creator).

The program is inspired by similar project created by Stefan Gordon's [dotmatrixtool](https://github.com/stefangordon/dotmatrixtool)

## Rewrite in pure javascript

The initial development was based on Stefan Gordon's work and was written in jQuery. I have rewrite the code in pure javascript to remove the dependency of jQuery. The initial file app.jquery.js is kept for reference only.
